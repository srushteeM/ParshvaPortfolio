        My name is Parshva Jogani. I’m 13 years old. I live in Gujarat, India
        and I study Game designing here. <br />Before I commenced designing
        games, I’ve continually been developing, but not just mini-games. I made
        digital programs, simulations, and small web pages. You see, I’ve always
        been busy doing creative stuff in my free time. Though, I didn’t know
        coding and all. Or... well, I knew it, I just didn’t know it all that
        much. <br />Nonetheless, one year ago I started my Study and got pushed
        to work with developing my games. And after an hour of doing random
        stuff, I fell in love with it.
